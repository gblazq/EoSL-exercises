# EoSL-exercises
Jupyter notebook with solutions to the exercises on the Elements of Statistical Learning book.

Github's viewer doesn't render some Latex environments correctly. It's better to download the notebooks or [open them in Jupyter's nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/gblazq/EoSL-exercises/tree/master/)

## TODO
